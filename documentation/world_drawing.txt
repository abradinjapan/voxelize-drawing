Chunk buffer layout:
    u8: - [ Position: Inside Chunk Vertex X Coordinate ]
    u8: - [ Position: Inside Chunk Vertex Y Coordinate ]
    u8: - [ Position: Inside Chunk Vertex Z Coordinate ]
    u8: - [ Texture: Block Face Sub-Texture Numbers [u4: x, u4: y] ]
    u16: - [ Texture: Block Face Number [z] ]
    u16: - [ Reserved for future use (and because 32-bit numbers are the minimum in passing data from CPU to GLSL) ]

GUI buffer layout:
    u16: - [ Position: On Screen X Coordinate ]
    u16: - [ Position: On Screen Y Coordinate ]
    u16: - [ Position: Texture X Coordinate ]
    u16: - [ Position: Texture Y Coordinate ]
